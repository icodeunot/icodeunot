### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Johnny Salazar and I have been coding since 2020. My professional experience ranges from leading crews as a union ironworker, to preparing US individual taxes for high net-worth clients at one of the biggest companies on earth.

### I am currently looking for my first professional role as a software developer. Please have a look at my various repositories, or see my [PORTFOLIO SITE] for my consulting projects.
