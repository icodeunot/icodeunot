### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Johnny Salazar and I have been coding since 2020. Before discovering a passion for programming, my professional experience ranged from sales and service roles, to leading large crews as a union ironworker, to preparing US individual taxes for high net-worth clients. Currently, I am working with T-SQL as a business analyst in the medical supply field.

### I will be graduating in 2023, from Western Governors University, with a bachelor's in Software Development with a discipline in Java. I am currently looking for my first software developer role and feel my professional experience brings invaluable functionality to a team. Please have a look at my various repositories, or see my [PORTFOLIO SITE] for my consulting projects.
